## Introduction<a name="1"></a>

Precision medicine is defined as the act of tailoring medical treatment such that it takes into consideration the individual characteristics of each patient's case [1]. Traditionally, medicine has been practiced with a "one fits all" approach, where the same standard tests and common drugs are used to treat the same phenotypically-appearing symptoms. This new approach of precision medicine looks beyond phenotype by gathering a genetic understanding of the individual's disease and applying it to how health care is delivered to the patient.

To gather a genetic understanding of a patient's disease, various types of data are taken into consideration. This includes the patient's genetic/health history, their response to the disease, and their lifestyle. Each of these factors are significant in understanding how the patient's disease may have developed as well as how it can currently be characterized.

> FAQ: What is the difference between "precison" medicine and "personalized" medicine? "Personalized" was used initially, but this term gave rise to the concern that it would be misinterpreted as using an approach that is unique to _each_ person. However, the idea is not that an individual receives their very own unique treatment; the idea is that targeted therapies are developed based on molecular diagnostics. "Personalized" medicine refers to the practice of handling a patient's care hollistically, while "precision" medicine refers to the science of creating evidence-based medicine [2].

## Pharmacogenomics<a name="2"></a>

The process of delivering precision medicine does not end when a targeted therapeutic drug is developed. It must continue with ensuring if the patient will respond well and effectively to it. This gives way to an integral field of precision medicine - pharmacogenomics. Pharmacogenomics is the study of how genes and genetic variations affect a patient's response to therapeutic drug treatment [3]. This involves taking a hollistic approach in drug design to minimize chances of adverse health effects because knowing a patient's genetic makeup can help with predicting the outcome of certain therapies. Pharmacogenomics allows scientists and doctors to address questions such as: will the drug optimally target the abnormality that needs fixing? Will it induce any negative side effects known to occur in the patient? Will it potentially cause further complications due to other genetic factors that must be considered for this patient?

Research has been and is currently being done to further scientists' knowledge on how genetic variations can affect the human body's response to medications. For instance, the Human Genome Project is working towards combining sequencing information gathered from many genomes with current knowledge on gene functions to enhance drug discovery by understanding why particular genotypes found in these genomes respond a certain way - and therefore identifying subpopulations that may benefit most from a certain drug [4]. Although the current use of pharmacogenomics is still quite limited due to a continued need for growing knowledge, it will further the development of tailoring drugs to treat a wide range of health problems in the future.


## Precision Medicine in Cancer<a name="3"></a>

##### History via Breast Cancer Treatment<a name="31"></a> 

The first forms of breast cancer treatment included removal of the ovaries - which would completely interrupt the hormonal feedback loop, as ovaries produce and release estrogen. However, in the 1970s, it was discovered that this kind of treatment was not necessary for patients with estrogen-receptor positive tumors. Rather these patients could benefit from anti-estrogen agents that block their tumors from receiving the growth-stimulating estrogen. By 1984, with the help of microarrays and gene expression profiling techniques, it was further discovered that some breast cancer patients (approximately 20%) could be characterized by abnormal HER-2 gene expression. Once more, efforts were made to develop targeted drug therapy, leading to the creation of Herceptin for inhibiting the function of the protein produced from this gene. In the 1990's, scientists found that 5% of breast cancer patients inherited genetic defects in genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, causing doctors to begin screening and watching for this mutation in patients. As this timeline shows, precision medicine has allowed for the creation and implementation of treatments that are more effective/beneficial to specific patients based on the characterization of their disease.  

##### Modern Usage<a name="32"></a>

###### Types of Treatment<br>
Current treatments for cancer include a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy - each meant to be applied under specific conditions of the patient [5]. A common form of precision medicine is providing hormonal therapy based on a patient's gene abnormalities (is there a protein that can be targeted?) or tumor characteristics (does the tumor have hormone receptors that can be blocked?) As the figure below shows, there is a correlation between longer survival and the use of precision medicine.

###### Modern Usage<br>
Since precision medicine is still a growing field, it is not used for most patients today. However, research and clinical trials continue to contribute to current knowledge such that its usage can grow as well. To find out a patient's eligibility for precision medicine, often a biopsy will be ordered to take a sample from the tumor mass which will get sent to testing to determine the tumor's chemical and genetic characteristics.

###### Economics<br>
One of the constraints hindering the growth of precision medicine usage is cost. Since it requires many years to develop specific treatments to target certain types of cancer, the treatments often end up being expensive by the time theyâ€™re available. However, if patients agree to participate in clinical trials, the cost of testing can be sponsored by the researchers.
